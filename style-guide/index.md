how 2 write like me
thought up independently of but encouraged by the existence of [xanthe's style guide](https://satyrs.eu/styleguide/) as well as [chridd's list of neologisms](https://chridd.nfshost.com/made-up-words/)
if this interests you then so may [jan Misali's punctuation analysis](https://www.seximal.net/punctuation)

# markup

## case

i write in all lowercase by default, not making exceptions for the pronoun `i` nor proper names (except toki pona ones)
when capitalization does occur it's usually used for emphasis (e.g. `it just Doesn't Work Like That`)

## numbers

i almost always write numbers as digits, except in compounds like `twofold` and such

## punctuation

general rule: punctuation represents not only grammar things but also how the text would be intonated if it were spoken

no period at the end of the sentence other than to clarify intonation (e.g. `huh.` as opposed to `huh` which feels like a question), or rarely a serious tone
non-question non-exclamation sentences are instead most commonly separated with line breaks, sometimes with [commas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma_splice), rarely with semicolons
this can cause ambiguity when the end of one sentence ends up on the right side of the screen, making it look like it continues into the next line (this website avoids it by making each sentence a "paragraph" with minimal padding and making actual paragraphs be `<div>`s)
commas and question marks are also often omitted except where that would cause ambiguity
multiple commas (2 by default, can even be 1 sometimes) are used as [ellipses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellipsis), which is [quite popular among youngins it seems](https://www.babbel.com/en/magazine/comma-ellipses)
[oxford comma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_comma) is yes

## quotation marks

my brain likes to interpret quotation marks as [scare quotes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scare_quotes) even when they're not, so instead i used to tend to use backticks (`` ` ``), which due to [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) makes the text look like code in places like reddit and discord and this website
this doesn't really happen anymore but i'll keep it on this page because why not
when i intend to do scare quotes i often multiply them a bunch, e.g. `"""""dubious"""""`
when discussing other languages (e.g. toki pona), i use backticks to quote that language and quotation marks for english, with angle quotes (`«»`) used for tertiary languages

when periods etc exist, i put the ending punctuation of a quoted sentence inside the quotation marks and the ending punctuation of the outer sentence outside the quotation marks; should be common sense but [apparently it isn't](https://writeshop.com/how-to-use-quotation-marks/) (though i do admit doubled punctuation can look a bit weird, e.g. `They said "Let's go.".`)

## apostrophe

very important, almost never omitted (unlike most other lowercase users)

## asterisk

the usual usage is for [roleplay](#in-roleplay), a la `*nuzzles u*`, which usually turns into italics
when using it for corrections i do `*you're` instead of the `you're*` that many seem to do, because the latter implies that there's a footnote attached to *it* rather than it *being* the footnote

## slash

regular usage: `i want a cat/dog/whatever`
square brackets when part of word: `i want a [boy/girl/enby]friend`
spaces around slashes when more than one word: `i want sugar / spice / everything nice` (or `i want sugar/spice/everything·nice`)

i write reddit notation with a slash at the start: `/u/SonjaLang posted on /r/tokipona`
i usually prefer a slash at the end of a url: `{{ page.url | absolute_url }}`

## square brackets

aside from the above i also use them for marking content warnings, e.g. `[spooky] <spoiler>boo</spoiler>`

used with `@` for marking topics: `@[long animals] weasels are pretty underrated tbh`

## colon

sometimes used for: [queen deltarune's secondary typing quirk](https://hushbugger.github.io/drdia/#ch2%20city08:14)

## tilde

used at the start of a word to mean "about/roughly", e.g. `~every` means "pretty much every"
used at the end of a word for a singsongy tone that one might associate with intimacy~

## interpunct

the interpunct (`·`) is so cool that it gets a special shortcut on my keyboard, [altgr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AltGr) + `.` (and you can do it too with [autohotkey™](https://autohotkey.com/))
i use it to mark suffixes after single letters or acronyms (`nft·s`, `ssh·ing`, but `ddos'd`), as well as "clarify" hyphen nesting order

## strikethrough

strikethrough marks sentences that i'd mumble under my breath in speech, sorta like [`/j`](https://tonetags.carrd.co/)
sadly this is misunderstood by others often enough that i have `hts` set as a shortcut for `hence the strikethrough`

## trademark sign

a trademark sign can mark that a given word/phrase has a,, special meaning i guess? kinda like the `Soon™` meme but with a broader fuzzier harder to define meaning (maybe it's just emphasis or random spice who knows)

## arrows

on pc i have [wincompose](http://wincompose.info/), on android i have gboard and emoji
most common is `↑` which i use to refer to the previous message (where others use `^`)
i like sometimes replacing directions like `top right` with the corresponding arrows (`↗`)

## in roleplay

- *italics* (or \*asterisks\* if no markdown) for actions and emphasis ()
- (parentheses) for in-character asides
- [square brackets] for thoughts/telepathy
- {curly braces} for out-of-character

# grammar

## [rule of funny](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny)

[verb all the nouns](https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1993/01/25), [mispluralize all the wordi](https://www.thefreelibrary.com/Foxen+in+the+Henhice.-a0133864435), *doubly* pluralize all the pluralses, if it looks funny then do it

## casualness

- technically-unnecessary filler, so like y'know the uh,, yeah )every so often i wanna stop using it but then i don't)
- i often quote memes instead of speaking normally, which might partly be due to autism idk
- initial `i` is omitted sometimes <small>(i think because once i tried out a writing style stats thing and it said i use it a lot and i've been self-conscious about that ever since)</small>

no textspeak abbreviations though, except [specific ones](#abbreviations) (and acronyms like `tbh`, `mfw`, etc)

## uncasualness

- i sometimes go sesquipedalian, either for comedic effect or because i genuinely don't know the simple word for the given thing (which doesn't mean i'll use the complex word correctly)
- `2 (two)` is funny

## pedantry

- i use `one` instead of generic `you` because it makes more sense to me (though i'm having trouble getting used to doing it and end up writing `you` first before changing it)
- when marking for possession, i add `'s` even after words that already end in `s` (e.g. [`tails's tools`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v15HWmwxuZo)), unless they're plural
- i'm specific about my negation placement (sometimes), distinguishing between e.g. `not supposed to` (where doing the thing might be fine) and `supposed not to` (where doing the thing is explicitly not fine)

## unpedantry

- incorrect articles/pluralization, e.g. `a goats` or even `an goats`

## leftism

- no generic `he`, gender-neutrality all the way (even in [polish](#polish)); example people can get random pronouns though (including neopronouns)
- no intelligence-based insults, so no r-word but also no e.g. `dumb` (`silly` is fine as it has a positive tone)

## extrapolation

- if `don't` can be a thing then why not `y'all'dn't've` (= `you all would not have`)
- if the plural of `octopus` is `octopi` then for `corpus` i'll do `corpi` and you can't stop me (not in serious writing though)
- somewhat relevant is forcing local patterns, such as alliteration (e.g. `special spoon spection` (from "section")) or pluralization (`i don't want 2 bottles i want 1 bottles`)
- extrapolating metaphors is fun, e.g. `they call me a jack of all trades but i feel more like a 9`

## regionality

generally american english but i feel like e.g. `labelled` looks better than `labeled`
usually [24-hour time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24-hour_clock) except when it feels wrong or ambiguous, in which case 12-hour time without a space before the period name (e.g. `4:20am`)
for dates i do year-month-day, as in [iso-8601](https://xkcd.com/1179/), or rather [html syntax](https://ijmacd.github.io/rfc3339-iso8601/) which allows a space between time and date and also allows partial notation (though for month-day i do a single preceding hyphen instead of two, a la `-04-20`)

# pronunciation

(this section uses the [international phonetic alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet) to notate pronunciation)

my target accent is american-ish but since i tend to pronounce vowels like in polish it ends up being kinda british

i like pronouncing <c> as /ts/ (like in polish), distinguishing between e.g. \<cis\> and \<sis\>

i jokingly pronounce <gif> with an overenunciated /χ/, and seriously with a /g/

# uncategorized things

- repetition of things, e.g. `hmhmhm`
- lists are cool (such as this one), and i'll sometimes do,, i wanna say a meme format? where i go like `cool new pants / ☑ cool / ☑ new / ☑ pants`
- when doing numbered lists i'll often do `1) b)` or `a) 2)`, usually then continued with `iii) four)`
- when sending several messages that [start with / are] the same word i'll often add superscript numbers to them, e.g. `looks impressive / but it's impractical / but² i wanna use it anyway / but³ idk what for`
- in chat, `---` in its own line marks a topic change; in conversations with [my nerd friend](https://cheddr.dev/) i instead use `!rel` as in "unrelated" (and `rel` for related and `~rel` for quasi-related)
- tonetags i use: `/gen` (genuine, neither joking nor sarcastic), `/ref` (reference), sometimes `/j` (joking) but i prefer [strikethrough](#strikethrough) for that
- au notation (`fell!sans`) for other things (e.g. `preverb!alasa`)
- cutting sentences off, e.g. `anyway here's`
- removing articles, e.g. `how do i make thing do thing`
- i know it shouldn't matter but things like `amature` or `existance` or `made it's rounds` bug me because They're Not Correct!!
- some people do `.` as a mid-sentence pause, it's cool but i don't do it (yet?)
- i haven't actually done it much but i've had the idea to refer to the left/right sides of an image as `west`/`east`, so that it's not confused for the character's left/right
- in speech i sometimes pronounce <c> as /ts/ (like in polish) where others would do /s/, e.g. in `cis`
- `[]` for placeholders, e.g. `if you're a []loid fan please talk to me`
- if there's 2 options that people fight over then i might make up a 3rd, kinda to make fun of it
	- `/gɪf/` or `/dʒɪf/`? how about `/χɪf/`
	- `color` or `colour`? how about `coloure`
	- `autistic` or `with autism`? how about `be-autism'd`
- sed replacement syntax instead of asterisks, e.g. `spike is best pony | s/spike/gummy/` (discord actually supports editing with this which makes it take a bit more effort to actually send it, i usually do a backslash before the first slash to avoid it)
- never `farther`, only `further`
- `-` at the start of a line for a,, sudden start i wanna say, e.g. `-oh actually`
- i don't use `frick`, it just sounds eh to me personally

# deprecated

i used to capitalize the name [`Ralsei`](https://deltarune.fandom.com/wiki/Ralsei) and all pronouns referring to ~~Him~~ him, due to a running gag in the [ralsei bot](https://ralsei.chlod.net/) discord server that he's a god

# other languages

## polish

not much to say other than that interpuncts come before suffixes for foreign words (`microsoft·u`) and that for people of unknown gender i like to use ligatures (`zrobiłæś`) and [naturally genderless forms](https://zaimki.pl/unikanie) (`zdarzyło ci się zrobić`)
also very insistent about potatoes being `ziemniaki` not `kartofle`

## toki pona

sentences on the same line are split with an interpunct with spaces on either side
in semi-formal writing, interpuncts are also added at the *start and end* of the line (for æsthetic symmetry), disambiguating automatic mid-sentence line breaks from intentional ones
commas around `la` and after `taso` are not used, but the function of a semicolon after `ni` is fulfilled by an arrow pointing right; arrows can also point left to function as a backwards semicolon of sorts
example:

> · open pi tenpo suno ni la mi kama lukin e ni → soweli li moku e kasi ale mi ← ni li ike tawa mi · taso mi ken ala ike tawa soweli tan suwi ona ·
{:lang="tok"}

i (usually) *don't* use `meli`/`mije`/`tonsi`, `oko`, `epiku`, or `puwa` (i think of `ko` as mostly meaning "squish" and would rather have a nimisin for "powder")
i do use `namako`, `kin`, `kipisi`, `monsuta`, `leko`, `n`, `majuna`, `linluwi`, `kiki`, `taki`, and `te`/`to` (but mostly just `te` as a sort of headnoun, e.g. `te "kipisi" li pona`)

i *don't* use `tawa` as "for", as in `mi pali tawa pona jan` → "i work for the good of humanity"
i also don't use `pali` as a generic verb, but rather only "work (a job)" and "create"; for "i do something" i do `mi ijo (e ijo)`

i enjoy transitive preposition phrases, e.g. `mi tawa ma Pasiju e sina` = `mi tawa e sina tawa ma Pasiju`
i also enjoy modifying preverbs and prepositions with things other than `ala`, hyphenating them for clarity, e.g. `mi sona-wawa toki pona` = `sona mi pi toki pona li wawa`

i usually don't tokiponize names except sometimes really well-known ones, like `ma Pasiju` for brazil above, `ma Mewika` for the us (though i prefer `ma Juwese`), `toki Inli` for english, `ilo Siko` for discord i guess,
i like putting them in sitelen·pona-esque cartouches, e.g. `ilo [GitHub]`, supposedly so that i can disambiguate `toki pona` from `toki [pona]` but mostly it's just quirky

`kin la` ("also,") becomes just `kin`, for symmetry with `taso`

i use `pona` only as "good" and `wile` only as "want" and i Will rant about this
i also think `pilin` might be a preverb but eh
