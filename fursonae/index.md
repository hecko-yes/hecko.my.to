the characters that i've made, for various degrees of "made"
generally all of these are canonically he/they/etc like me (except [helping hoof](#helping-hoof) and [floaty](#floaty) which are more it/its), *but* feel free to use other pronouns too (since i'm not super connected to them and also don't mind pronouns in general)
you-the-reader hereby have my permission to draw / remix / steal / do *literally whatever* with any of these if you so desire, as per [cc0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) (though note that other people's art featured here isn't under that, and also if you ship them with others my partner won't like it)
not picky about colors for the record, though i quite like the [pico-8 extended palette](https://lospec.com/palette-list/pico-8-secret-palette)

kinda funny that even though a fursona is supposed to represent me i instead keep making characters that i'd want to hug, and one can't really hug oneself properly can one (though i suppose [the fox](#fox) has clones and [the creature](#creature) can wrap itself up in its tail)

**current main is [floaty](#floaty)**, distantly followed by [the fox](#fox) and [emerald snap](#emerald-snap)

general traits:
- very cuddly, will hug the heck out of you for eons if you let them
- voice could be similar to [timber puppers's ralsei](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZiyMuvfi-E) and [tyler scowcroft's ring from ring fit adventure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ySV2xtEIGA), or perhaps [wynton yang's ralsei](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Vfc61BjhUQ) and [sibylline sounds' bookshop skunk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJmMstb7_E) [fetish cw for their other videos] and [schazer's winner (tpot)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YG5M7Q26U2s)
- usually idealized toony bodies, as in no organs or bones or biological trappings like sweating or having to eat or sleep or being harmable
- preferably either 5 fingers with opposable thumbs or no fingers with magical dexterity (or the pseudo-thumb thing [amphimorphos](https://amphimorpho.carrd.co/#info) have going on)

# ghost fox
2018-08-12

not really a fursona but it is the first animal sorta-character i remember making
made for a shitposty collaborative comic thing, where the first action by someone other than me was to kill my character (hence ghost)

![fox-eared humanoid stickman waves and says "Hi"](ghost-fox/IMG_20180812_212917.png)
![same creature, now a ghost, saying "m" in very stretched comic sans](ghost-fox/IMG_20180813_094114.png)

# fox
2018-11-28

**[gallery!](fox/)**

my main character, scruffy pure-white snoutless fox (tail size undefined)
originally with [ralsei](https://deltarune.fandom.com/wiki/Ralsei)'s clothing and [sans](https://undertale.fandom.com/wiki/Sans)'s glowing blue eye but nowadays not really
in some iterations he can "clone" himself (have multiple bodies) and/or turn into a four-legged fox

started out like so:
1. a long time ago i used to use images of [tails the fox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tails_(character)) as profile pictures
2. i wanted to have a funny sans version of him for my discord avatar and i stumbled upon a cursed mess that i'm not sure if i still have
3. i added ralsei features to it (2018-11-28)
	![headshot of tails from a very bad comic, turned pure white, with a sans eye, and Ralsei's clothes ms painted on](fox/hecko fox avatar.png){:.copyrighted}
4. electriclizardfren drew it for some reason (2019-09-15)
	![full-body drawing of the above, very high quality, there are even little cat paws for hands](fox/Untitled96_20190915093604_cropped.png){:.copyrighted style="width: 400px; max-width: 100%;"}
5. i drew/generated a [set of deltarune-style talksprites](https://github.com/Sobsz/heckosprites) for it for [Ralsei·bot](https://ralsei.chlod.net/)-assisted roleplay (2019-11-30)
	![pixelated sprite of him sticking his tongue out and blushing](fox/dpb.png)
6. now it's my fursona i guess

also has a pony version

# wesley
2018-12-26

anthro bear with gold fur, 2/3rds human height apparently? i don't remember writing that, i usually imagine him as regular height
can summon illusions with varying degrees of solidity
mute, uses the above to summon subtitles
see [here](https://gist.github.com/Sobsz/38dc8aa415f53697ab04d4e9d2ffa0dd) for more details (though i wrote it when i was younger and more foolish so it has some amount of yikes)

not used a whole lot unfortunately

# ignios
2019-08-11

deltarune boss monster oc with gold fur and a sun motif on his chest

# geck
2020-02-07/09

green anthro gecko with 4 arms and (barely visible in the picture) acid-green pawpads on the hands, also horns for some reason
mostly just an attempt to sculpt something in blender
[download .blend file here](geck/geck.blend) if you wish (contains non-functional rig)

# ponies

of specifically the [mlp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Little_Pony:_Friendship_is_Magic) variety

## helping hoof
2021-05-28

yes the name is cringe but i couldn't think of a better one, i don't use the name often anyway

white synthetic honse made of a marshmallow-like material with a grid pattern\*, optionally a bit smaller than usual, wearing a collar
has both wings and horn because why not
a possible lore is that it was a robot-esque thing (hence more it/its) made to serve and that the collar keeps it obedient, and/or when you tap the collar gem it flashes and listens for commands like a virtual assistant; another possible lore is that it says the collar does so but really it just likes to do stuff for people

\*unfortunately i don't have a picture with both grid and hair so try to mentally put the first 2 images together

## bashful byte
2022-07-10

i don't like it

![pone with purple body, green eyes, red-green-blue mane, pinkish wings and tail, subtle chest fluff](ponies/bashful byte sprite big.png){:.copyrighted}

## emerald snap
2022-08-13

i do like it

![pone with bright teal body, dark teal countershading and hoof stripes and eyes, acid green spiky mane and wings and tail](ponies/emerald snap sprite big.png){:.copyrighted}

also has a pic made for funkin' is magic using [this base by bbpanzu](https://twitter.com/bbpnz213/status/1670682977230114816) but it's rushed and not very good

# plushies

made for a now-inactive [deltarune](https://en.wikipedia.org/Deltarune) roleplay, part of an implied set of dozens (of common species that aren't already represented in deltarune)
they/them, sometimes it/its

## topaz
2022-07-18

magic geek, has turned into a sort of phoenix once

![anthro owl in ruby coat](bonus/topaz avatar.png)

## saffron
2022-11-04 - 2022-11-10

started out normal, became smug in an effort to outsmug the main villain, immediately regretted it and became snowdrop instead to have people not hate him

mostly made by electriclizardfren, included for completeness
not pictured: unlimited stretchability (with constant width, in toony defiance of conservation of mass)

# creature
ideation started 2022-10-11, most recent update 2023-02-22

made of synthetic marshmallow again (no bones or anything), though i'll allow a bit of fuzz (makes more sense on the dark bits but the neon ones are allowed too)
only somewhat modeled after real specieses, e.g. the hooves are explicitly not realistic because i dislike that bump they have in e.g. mlp
the model turned out 7'3" (220 cm) in internal units and tbh that sounds about right

the sparkly neon regions (fully variable rgb btw) are supposed to be translucent regions of the body showing the creature's insides (100% neon goop)
tail can be rolled and unrolled to any size (to infinity and beyond) through toon logic; ears don't have that but could probably be rolled into spirals for convenience (like hair rolls)

it does canonically have a mouth i just don't know how to model it properly
the hands are placeholders, ideally they'd be big 5-fingered pawbs with stick-out beans
ideally the tail spiral wouldn't end in a hole but i couldn't figure out how to model that with my method

unsure about head shape, particularly snout size
might remove the neck fluff, i wanted it large enough to function as [hammerspace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hammerspace) but i can't figure out how to do that well
idk if i want the stripes everywhere, maybe just regular [countershading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countershading)? **[see last image]**
kinda considered inverting tail pattern (`texture alt` in the .blend file matches that), pros: dim fuzzy inside to curl up in, cons: inconsistent with inside of ears being neon, looks bad; stripes on the sides would fit though so maybe
legs might be better off just being [rubberhose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_hose_animation) instead of my attempt at a semi-realistic shape (would help make it possible for the soles of the hooves to touch each other which for some reason appeals to me)

[have a .blend file](creature/another fursona test.blend) (3.4, messy, unrigged)

![t-posing anthro creature; most of its body is a dark slightly-purple blue, but there are some stripes on the limbs and a heart pattern on the chest that are a shiny neon magenta-to-cyan gradient (which also occurs on its eyes and snout and blush lines); big goat ears half as long as the creature is tall with neon on the underside, thick limbs (regular arms and stubby hoof legs), neck fluff, almost body-size tail behind it (the inner half is neon and the outer is blue)](creature/blender_SaduRfyIKK.png)
![orthogonal front view](creature/blender_8C6WVPyxX6.png)
![orthogonal side view, showing a cartoony dashed blush, some chub in the front, the spiraliness of the tail, and the profile of the hooves](creature/blender_EKAOTtskK5.png)
![close-up of the tail, showing the subtle sparkles in the neon regions (as well as a small hole in the center of the spiral which i couldn't figure out how to remove)](creature/blender_zXfx36GChH.png)
![view from the bottom in "off" mode (the neon regions are græy but still sparkly), showing the beans in all their glory, the jankiness of the hand shapes, and the featurelessness of the hooves](creature/blender_C4S5OVQYYN.png)
![an alternate coloring scheme, where instead of stripes there are solid fields of neon: a thick strip going down from the neck to the crotch and continuing into the tail (with another strip on the other side of said tail), and the "feet" of the hooves are neon too; ears and face are still neon](creature/blender_9kagAKd291.png)

# deer
2023-02-22 (at like 3am)

probably my first non-cuddlemaxxed character

pink body, very·hot-pink beans and hooves, light-yellow [countershading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countershading) and inside of ears (and ear fluff probably), yellow eyes and neck fluff
plush maybe? not necessarily for cuddle purposes, i just feel it'd be neat (though idk if useful hands would fit it well)
i usually do plain colors but maybe this time i could/should do some sort of spots? freckles at least?
probably both anthro and feral forms; anthro probably gets paws (maybe cat paws so it can be a [bappy](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Bappers) mew [deer](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/happy_New_Year#English))
male-ish but no antlers ~~because [noelle deltarune](https://deltarune.fandom.com/wiki/Noelle) stole them~~ (actually because i feel they'd get in the way, also i have been informed female reindeer have antlers too)
glasses? collar? skirt? ~~thigh-highs?~~ (nah because they'd cover up the hoofsies)

no proper canonical picture yet but have [a wip blender model](deer/deersona.blend) (main deviations: no ear fluff, no spots, fingers are thinner than i'd like them to be, beans are weird):
![anthro deer with paws and feral hooves, the yellow areas are around the jaw and around the legs (like pants), saturated yellow is for short hair that wraps around the back to join with neck fluff, the hands are somewhat paw-like, the nose and beans and hooves are red and shiny like lipstick, the tail is short and plump and yellow on the bottom](deer/blender_CNBAEX0BVs.png)

# floaty
2023-06-23 - 2023-07-04, main as of 2024-01-07

cat but it stands for <u>c</u>at-<u>a</u>djacent <u>t</u>hing (as in it's a synthetic creature by nature and only superficially catlike)
other terms include: creature, thing, entity, plushie-coded, meowshmallow (courtesy of brionna), fairy, [counterfeit cat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterfeit_Cat), ~~bootleg [hello kitty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hello_Kitty),~~
floaty was a codename but is now just a name, inspired by it floating like [mew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mew_(Pok%C3%A9mon))
more it/its than most
1.3m (= 4'3") minus ears

no fur or bones or organs, just marshmallowy squish all the way through (a not-yet-defined synthetic substance, similar to what i imagine toons are made of ("toonium"), and also kinda similar to [the menagerie's mindmatter](https://the-menagerie.neocities.org/matter))
and yes, it does taste like marshmallow (the hot pink is strawberry, the yellow is gooey sweet lemon), and may be edible (though it regenerates immediately)
the yellow bits glow, the pawpads are thick and squishy
**the tail shall be huge**, none of my references show it adequately yet but body-sized and up is prefered (but if that's out of your comfort zone that's fine)
the curl of the tail may be used for storage (and may be a pocket dimension)
despite lack of mouth it can talk and even [eat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzm3sNl8VwQ); it may wear face masks to express emotions like owo
it often hovers at about average adult human height to better interact with stuff made for humans, it can fly higher up when needed but probably not too much
[digital meow?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ca00eaT7CzU)

canonically self-made, as in an it's an amateur (me!) who designed a new body for itself (because the weakness of its flesh disgusted it) and it lives as it now
made to be compatible with human society (e.g. it can drive a car if given a booster seat), and if there's a problem then feel free to handwave it (e.g. it can scratch things because something something voluntary matter compression at its fingertips, it can lick things because uhh it has a mouth now)
remarkably similar to [wesley](#wesley) despite the 4.5-year gap

potential changes i haven't applied to the reference yet (you may pick and choose at will):
- mouth (drawn with it sometimes, depending on situation; inside is purple, for tongue i like yellow but that's not set in stone)
- cat tail instead of squirrel tail (used when i don't feel like drawing a big tail or if the scene would be too cluttered)
- sparkles in yellow bits
- headphones (shaped like a neko headset for humans but the neko ears go on the real ones and that's where the speakers are; glowing based on the volume of whatever it's listening to)
- make the wings holographic or otherwise non-solid?
- multiple bodies like [the fox](#fox)
- more wing-shaped wings (meh)
