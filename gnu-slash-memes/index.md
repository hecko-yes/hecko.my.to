an index of memes, memeables, and pop culture items, under public licenses such as [creative commons](https://creativecommons.org/) or in the [public domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain)

**most of the time this doesn't matter** because youtube has contracts for most of the world's music and the other companies know better than to sue random memesters for giving them free marketing
**but** if you're publishing something commercially (or if your teacher insists on properly licensed material for your slideshow) and you wanna put a haha funny in it then this might be helpful

[ctrl+f](https://www.takeflyte.com/what-the-ctrl-f) is your friend here

a quick rundown of how the license column works:
- [`pd`](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/mark/1.0/) (public domain) means it's too old for copyright so do Literally Whatever; this may vary depending on your country
- [`0`](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) means much the same but applied intentionally, so the work is probably more modern
- [`by`](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) means credit (e.g. link in the description, maybe a sneaky watermark if in an image); however it *also* usually means no drm which might be an issue if you're developing for ios
- [`sa`](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) means if you publish edits of it (or things synced to it if music) you have to release them under the same license
- [`nd`](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/) means don't you dare publish edits of it
- [`nc`](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/) means non-commercial
- `id` means it's only for individuals (or sometimes co-ops, small businesses, etc), sometimes de facto so by being [explicitly informal](https://www.boringcactus.com/2021/09/29/anti-license-manifesto.html); sure it kinda goes against the point of the list but not entirely i don't think
- `*` means there's a catch because copyright is often not as shrimple as that
- `?` means i'm kinda sure but not *entirely* sure so if you need utter safety then avoid it (and if you have information then tell me)

very lacking as of current; if you have any suggestions then contact is appreciated

| [music by kevin macleod](https://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/music.html) | by | there used to be a way to see the most popular songs but it seems to be gone now; "[carefree](https://www.incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/index.html?isrc=USUAN1400037)" is the infamous royalty-free ukulele song |
